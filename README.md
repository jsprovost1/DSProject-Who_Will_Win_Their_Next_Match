# Who Will Win Their Next Match?

## Introduction
The name "_Pok√©mon_" comes from the contraction of "pocket" and "monster", and was first introduced in 1989 when the first video game was released on the GameBoy. The goal of the game was to collect the different species of Pokemons, and to train some of your creatures in order to compete against other players. The outcome of a fight could be influenced by the characteristics of each Pokemon. 
In this notebook, we will explore these characteristics as published on the **_[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge)_**. This journey will include two parts: 
  - An exploration of the data
  - A prediction of who will win their next match

## Exploration Of The Data
In the first section, we will explore the characteristics of the different Pokemons and perform data analysis in order to extract specific information about this sample. Furthermore, we will perform feature engineering which will be extremely useful in the second part where we will perform machine learning in order to predict the potential winner for each fight. This first section was done using R.

## Prediction Of The Next Winner
In this section, we tested several algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest to name a few. Our Random Forest ended up being the one which perform the best with a striking **_99% accuracy_** on our validation set. This second section was accomplished using scikit-learn in Python.
